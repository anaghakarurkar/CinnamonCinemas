## About Cinnamon Cinemas Theatre:
🎥. The Cinnamon Cinemas Movie Theatre has 15 seats, arranged in 3 rows of 5

● Rows are assigned a letter from A to C
● Seats are assigned a number from 1 to 5
As a 🍿 🎬 Cinnamon Cinemas Movie Theatre Manager
I want to allocate seats to customers
So that I can control reserved seating for the theatre

## Program User Story
This program allocates seats based on a random integer “number of
seats” between 1 and 3
This program allocates the required number of seats from the available
seats starting from seat A1 and filling the auditorium from left to right, front to
back
All of the seats are available for sale when the program starts
Program continues to allocate a random number of seats until it finds
there are not enough seats left to complete the request
Once there are not enough seats available to be allocated then the program 
ends.
